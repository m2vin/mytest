As per regulation collects detailed data on bank holding companies' (BHC) and intermediate holding companies' (IHC) various asset classes, capital components, and categories of pre-provision net revenue (PPNR) on a quarterly basis. The data is used to assess the capital adequacy of large BHCs and IHCs using forward-looking projections of revenue and losses, to support supervisory stress test models, and continuous monitoring efforts, as well as to inform the Federal Reserve's operational decision making as it continues to implement the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010.
